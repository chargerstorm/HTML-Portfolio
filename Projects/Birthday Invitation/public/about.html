  <b>About Me</b>
  <br />
  Greetings! I'm Octavio Mejia, and my journey has been a fascinating blend of
  technology and creativity. Growing up, the allure of computers always
  intrigued me—the sheer wonder of how they function and the vast expanse of the
  Internet captivated my imagination. Each unique website I encountered fueled
  my curiosity further, leading me down the path of information systems.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Passion meets profession:</b>
  <br />
  My academic endeavors crystallized my career aspiration: web development. But
  my interest didn't stop there. Photography has always held a special place in
  my heart. Since 2018, armed with my first camera and guided by a mentor, I've
  delved into portrait photography, capturing moments frozen in time.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Proud Moments:</b>
  <br />
  Two projects stand out in my academic journey: crafting a minesweeper game in
  C++ and designing a simple computer (RSC) using logic gates in Logisim. While
  they posed challenges, from intricate debugging to seeking guidance, the joy
  of seeing them come to fruition was unparalleled. These experiences taught me
  resilience and the power of perseverance.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Networking and Growth:</b>
  <br />
  I had the pleasure of participating in HackMT during my university days—a
  thrilling 36-hour sprint of ideation, creation, and collaboration. Interacting
  with peers from MTSU and beyond, alongside industry professionals, enriched my
  perspective and fueled my passion for innovation.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Beyond Pixels and Code:</b>
  <br />
  When I step away from screens and lenses, you'll find me immersed in a good
  book, especially those delving into the mysteries of space. And when the need
  for adrenaline kicks in, you might spot me running or hitting the gym,
  embracing the harmony of mind and body.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Looking Ahead:</b>
  <br />
  On the horizon of the next decade, I envision myself thriving as a web
  developer at a company that resonates with my values. With each keystroke and
  click, I'm crafting a future where passion meets purpose.
